# OBJECTS_SALE_PREDICTION_-ML_PROJECT-


## Objectives :
Create a project using sales dataset and creating a Machine Learning project. In this project, I picked up Dummy Market and Sales dataset from kaggle and applying Machine Learning algothim name "Linear Regression".


## About_Dataset :

In this data  'Data-Driven Marketing' and 'Data Science for Business'. Data contains:

1. TV promotion budget (in million).
2. Social Media promotion budget (in million).
3. Radio promotion budget (in million).
4. Influencer: Whether the promotion collaborate with Mega, Macro, Nano, Micro influencer.
5. Sales (in million).


## Follow these approach for Data-Preprocessing :

This data can be used for simple tasks:

1. Data preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Visualization.
4. Prediction using Linear Regression and Model Evaluation.

## Website :
After doing all these approach on dataset we upload that data set into "model.pkl" file . Then using micro web framework "Flask" for web browsing. Then I create a website using HTML and css file and use this model to perform on it.

## Goal :
Creating a Machine Learning Model using Linear Regression to find the desirable output of sales that show the market value ups and down, dependent on this increase the productivity of electical appliences.
